## NCEA Achievement Standard 91816 - text-based adventure game 

DISCLAIMER: This program does not store data on the web or on your device. A save system is a little outside of the scope of this project, sorry in advance if you lose your progress.

This is the complete version of the game! There are at the very least no game-breaking bugs. The main file is titled 'Text-adventure-main', which is the file that you need to run in order to play the game. Everything that you need to be looking at will be within the most recent menu(or possibly one previous one), with lines seperating each one for clarity I would strongly recommend looking at the 'textrpg_map' file in this folder as you play the game, as you can can get a visualisation of the map while you play, which will certainly help most people. The key for the map is provided below. The map works off of a standard tile-based x,y system for its movement, with specific tiles doing specific things, such as granting items, allowing you to access a shop, or start a battle encounter. In terms of balance, I apologise if it is a bit off - this project exists more as a proof-of-concept rather than a polished experience. 

To markers reading this README: I have reflected all of the relevant implications necessary: my code has comments throughout it, making it clear to anybody looking at this code in years from now without my guidance what each block does, with no unnessecary or broken code blocks in the script. I further show future-proofing by (not in all places, I'll admit) writing efficient code blocks, relying on functions with parameters to make sure this world map can work in the most effiecnt way possible. I have spent a lot of time testing my project to ensure it is free of bugs and that most if not all of the menus fully follow the formatting rules I have put in place. There are no syntax errors or misspellings, meaning that the script is fully functional at its intended task. In terms of ethicality; my project does not do anything that breaks ethical guidelines, and as mentioned in the actual script, this is not a malicious project. I have also not infringed upon any IP when making this game -- while it is generic and clearly playing off the ideas of old-school IPs, I have not included any names or game functions that are copyrighted or patented.
